# SkimX

SkimX streamlines web application development with OpenAPI schemas that validate and infer types, ensuring consistency between contracts and codebases.

The code is [MIT-licensed](https://github.com/ootkin/skimx/blob/main/LICENSE) and free for use.

## Features

- Simple development, because it's built on top of [Express](https://expressjs.com/).
- Data validation and type inference are performed using [Zod](https://zod.dev/).
- Generation of OpenAPI specifications using [zod-openapi](https://github.com/samchungy/zod-openapi).

_Note: tested on OpenAPI 3.1_
